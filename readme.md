# Responsive grid
### How to create a responsive grid with CSS and JS
For several project I've designed grids, because they look cool. However, it always bugged me how I was never able to make it fill the full page at a responsive way. So I wrote some code how to influence a HTML file to fill itself with a grid. My grid is filled with dots,  because I like it that way, but you can style your grid however you like using CSS.

## Anatomy of a grid
A grid consists of columns, rows and width. So we'll have to calculate and replicate this in order to fill the screen.

| Column| | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Row | `Module` | |
